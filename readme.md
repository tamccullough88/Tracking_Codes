# Customer Event Tracking Codes

## Overview
I decided to create tracking codes to use in the customer event since I noticed discrepancies between GA4 and Google Ads. Doing it this way helped me get more accurate data within my purchases and other events.
I am still in the process of writing these, but they work as is. 

Note, not all meta events work on all Shopify websites. I am not the only one to notice this when building customer events. The purchase even does work on all Shopify sites from what I have seen.
